# Rails Todo App


Checkout the way [this Todo app](http://todomvc.com/examples/jquery) works.
Ignore the sidebar on the left and just focus on the todo list part of the
page. Your task is to build a todo app, using Rails, that works and looks
exactly like this example.

## Requirements

- No authentication
- Every user sees the same TODO list
- No AJAX or Javascript
- Every link does a full page refresh
- Data is persisted to the server
- Ignore the `Double-click to edit a todo` feature


## Getting started

There is no repo to fork for this challenge. Create a new rails app using
the `rails new` command and then push it up to github.

```sh
rails new todo_list --skip-spring --database=postgresql --skip-test-unit ./rails-todo-app-class
```

Make your first commit:

```sh
git add . && git commit -m init
```

Create a new repo on github called `rails-todo-app-class` and follow their
directions to push your local repo up to Github.


## Stretch Goals

#### Deploy your app to heroku.
